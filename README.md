# PICO-8 import/export plugin for Tiled

## Seamlessly edit your PICO-8 carts in Tiled!

*Warning*: This plugin requires [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) version 1.5.0 or later.
As of February 20, 2021, this version is only available as a preview release.

If for some reason you want to use the old, deprecated Python version of this plugin, you
may check the old [python branch](https://github.com/samhocevar/tiled-pico8/tree/python).

# Installation

 - install Tiled:
   - download the [installer](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
   - run the installer
 - open the Tiled extension directory, either:
   - run Tiled
   - go to Edit → Preferences → Plugins
   - click on “Open…” in the Extensions section
 - (alternatively, you can open `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Tiled\extensions` on Windows)
 - download [`pico8.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samhocevar/tiled-pico8/master/pico8.js) and save it to that directory
