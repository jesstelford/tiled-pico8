# Installation

 - activate the Python plugin in Tiled
   - make sure you have a Python version compatible with Tiled
   - on Windows that would be [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/); make
     sure you choose to add Python to `PATH` in the installer.
   - in Tiled, go to Edit → Preferences… → Plugins and make sure python.dll is enabled
 - create a `.tiled` directory in your user directory
 - copy the `pico8.py` in that directory
